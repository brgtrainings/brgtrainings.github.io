# History of C Language

C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT & T Bell Labs in USA.

    quote="The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system. Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment."
