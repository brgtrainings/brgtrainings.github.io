# History of Python Language

In December 1989, Guido Van Rossum had been looking for a "'hobby' programming project that would keep him occupied
during the week around Christmas" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a "new
scripting language he had been thinking about lately: a descendant of
[ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} that would appeal to Unix/C
hackers".

He has explained that Python's predecessor, ABC, was inspired by SETL, noting that ABC co-developer Lambert
Meertens had "spent a year with the SETL group at NYU before coming up with the final ABC design".

In July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of
[Benevolent dictator for life(BDFL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life){:target="_blank"} of the
Python programming language.

### Name

He attributes choosing the name "Python" from British comedy series
[Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus){:target="_blank"}
which he used to enjoy while developing the language.

### Python Releases

- Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage
  collector and support for Unicode.
- Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely
  backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series.
  Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2
  code to Python 3.
- Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
  of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.

### Influence

Python was influenced by languages like ABC, Ada, ALGOL 68, C, C++, Haskell, Java, Lisp, Modula-3, Perl, Standard ML
etc

### Popular Implementations

- `CPython` is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C. It compiles Python programs into an
  intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine.
- `Jython` is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform. The
  implementation was formerly known as JPython until 1999.
- `IronPython` is an implementation of the Python programming language targeting the .NET Framework and Mono.
  The project is currently maintained by a group of volunteers at [GitHub](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3){:target="_blank"}. It is written entirely in C#, although some of its code is automatically generated by a code generator written in Python.
