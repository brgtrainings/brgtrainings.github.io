# Interactive Python - REPL

REPL is the language shell, the Python Interactive Shell. The REPL acronym is short for Read, Eval, Print and Loop.

The Python interactive interpreter can be used to easily check Python commands.
To start the Python interpreter, type the command `python3` without any parameter and hit the `return/enter` key.

The process is:

- Read: take user input
- Eval: evaluate the input
- Print: shows the output to the user
- Loop: repeat

## Do It Yourself (DIY)

Start the Python interactive shell by typing `python3` in your terminal or shell.

```shell
$ python3
Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 10 2020, 15:43:33)
[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.17)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

After the symbols `>>>` you can type a line of Python code, or a command.

```python
>>> "hello world"
'hello world'
>> print("hello world")
'hello world'
>>> 120
120
>>> 15/2
7.5
```
