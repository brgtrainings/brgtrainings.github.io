# Setup Developer Environment

In this page, you will learn how to setup your developer environment required for building professional websites.

## Editor

Although, you can use any editor you prefer but I highly recommend __VS Code__ which is quite popular among developers.

- Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com){:target="_blank"}
- Install _Live Server_ extension: After installing VS Code, I recommend you to install [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer){:target="_blank"} extension which would launch a local server with live reload feature for web pages. Following are the steps to install it:
  - Press `Shift + Ctrl + P` together
  - In the search bar, type `install` and click on `Extensions: Install Extensions`
  - On the left panel search bar, type `live server` by `Ritwick Dey` and click on it.
  - Press the `Install` button

## Code management tools

We will be using Git/GitHub for managing our code.

- [Download the Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads){:target="_blank"} and install it.
- Create an account in the [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Quick Code Sharing

[CodePen](https://codepen.io) has been one of the online code sharing service for HTML, CSS or JavaScript code snippets. It would come handy sharing code snippet for quick review during Bootcamp. _Create an account in it as well._
